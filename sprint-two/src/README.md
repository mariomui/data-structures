A tree would be great for....
Making a family tree.

A tree class, in functional with shared methods style, with the following properties:
.children property, an array containing a number of subtrees
.addChild() method, takes any value, sets that as the target of a node, and adds that node as a child of the tree
A .contains() method, takes any input and returns a boolean reflecting whether it can be found as the value of the target node or any descendant node
What is the time complexity of the above functions?
